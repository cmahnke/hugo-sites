# Hugo Sites

Clone and build this Hugo site to render a curated list of other sites built with Hugo.

To appear on this list, the site's home page must contain a `meta` element with the `name` attribute set to `generator`, and "Hugo" must appear in the `content` attribute.

The version, title, and description are retrieved from each site's home page every time this site is built.

With a cold `getresource` cache, Hugo builds this site in less than a minute. 

This list was compiled from:
- <https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/cool-sites-that-run-hugo/36815>
- <https://gohugo.io/showcase/>

To add a site to the list, please submit an issue.
