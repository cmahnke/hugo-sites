These sites were created with the [Hugo] static site generator.

[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io

To appear on this list, the site's home page must contain a `meta` element with the `name` attribute set to `generator`, and "Hugo" must appear in the `content` attribute. The version, title, and description are retrieved from each site's home page every time this site is built.

To add a site to this list, or to reclassify an existing item, please [submit an issue].
