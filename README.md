# Hugo Sites

This is the source code for [jmooring.github.io/hugo-sites], a curated list of sites built with the [Hugo] static site generator.

When Hugo builds this site, it retrieves data from each of the entries in the `content/sites` directory. To appear on the curated list, the each site's home page must contain a `meta` element with the `name` attribute set to `generator`, and "Hugo" must appear in the `content` attribute.

With a cold cache, this site typically builds in less than a minute.

To add a site to this list, or to reclassify an existing item, please [submit an issue].
